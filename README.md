# Overview
Step 1: As requirement, the equation has three object: Factor,Delta,Result.
Step 2: If factor of x squr = 0 then equation can have 1 result or empty
Step 3: After step 2 check factor of x = 0 then equation don't have result
Step 4: After step 2 check factor of x != 0 then equation has 1 result
Step 5: Calculate delta = b^2 - 4*a*c (b = factor of x; a = factor of x squr; c = constant)
Step 6: Check delta > 0 then equation have 2 result
Step 7: Delta = 0 then equation have 2 but the same
Step 8: Delta < 0 then equation donot have any result
